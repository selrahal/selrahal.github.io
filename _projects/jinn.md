Java Implemented Neural Networks (JINN) is a project I created because I am interested in neural networks and most of the current applications to simulate them are written with performance in mind and not clarity (using fast matrix operations and the like). In an effort to find a framework that is easy to use and understand I have created one. It currently has tests showing the API to create a simple perceptron, a neural network trained for the XOR operations, as well as a neural network trained to recognize handwritten digits using the [MNIST database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
