Cellular Automata Simulation SYstem (CASSY) is a project I created sparked by my interest in cellular automata. The canonical example of a cellular automata is [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). While implementing the game of life I found many other systems of cellular automata that yielded interesting behaviors and started abstracting away the logic specific to the game of life. CASSY includes many other simulations some which are game of life based ([Seeds]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeds_%28cellular_automaton%29), [Brian's Brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian%27s_Brain)), and others which are not ([Langton's Ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Langton%27s_ant), [WireWorld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireworld)). 

Take a look and contribute some other automata!!
