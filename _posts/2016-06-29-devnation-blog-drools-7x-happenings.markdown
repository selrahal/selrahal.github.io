I have a huge interest in the open source Drools and jBPM frameworks and am an avid proponent of their supported counterparts, BRMS and BPMS. Check out my guest [blog post](http://developers.redhat.com/blog/2016/06/29/devnation-live-blog-drools-7-x-happenings-and-roadmap/) for the Red Hat Developers Blog where I cover the newest set of features as well as some awesome stuff coming up in Drools 7.x.
