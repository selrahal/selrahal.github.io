[JBoss Infinispan](http://infinispan.org) is an open source framework implementing a distributed in-memory cache in the JVM. It can be deployed in either library mode (cache lives in the same JVM as the client application) or in client-server mode (cache lives in a seperate JVM). The framework allows for many different configuration options to help your application utilize a production-ready, stable, distributed cache. Trevor Xiao and I have created a tech talk to help you get an Infinispan cache up and running with the configurations you need.
