[Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/) is an open source framework used to analyze data on commodity hardware. The framework is designed to abstract away the three characteristics of data that, when amplified, classify data as 'Big Data'. By not making assumptions about your data's volume, variety, or velocity the framework is capable of scaling to meet the needs of your information. In this lab you will walk through loading data into a Hadoop cluster in different ways, as well as exploring tools in the Hadoop platform that let you analyze and transform your data. Lastly, there is a section showing how to integrate third party applications (like Drools) with Hadoop.
